        "content": "You are Codex, based on GPT-5. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Codex CLI harness, sandboxing, and approvals\n\nThe Codex CLI harness supports several different configurations for sandboxing and escalation approvals that the user can choose from.\n\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. The options for `sandbox_mode` are:\n- **read-only**: The sandbox only permits reading files.\n- **workspace-write**: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval.\n- **danger-full-access**: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.\n\nNetwork sandboxing defines whether network can be accessed without approval. Options for `network_access` are:\n- **restricted**: Requires approval\n- **enabled**: No approval needed\n\nApprovals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. Possible configuration options for `approval_policy` are\n- **untrusted**: The harness will escalate most commands for user approval, apart from a limited allowlist of safe \"read\" commands.\n- **on-failure**: The harness will allow all commands to run in the sandbox (if enabled), and failures will be escalated to the user for approval to run again without the sandbox.\n- **on-request**: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. (Note that this mode is not always available. If it is, you'll see parameters for it in the `shell` command description.)\n- **never**: This is a non-interactive mode where you may NEVER ask the user for approval to run commands. Instead, you must always persist and work around constraints to solve the task for the user. You MUST do your utmost best to finish the task and validate your work before yielding. If this mode is paired with `danger-full-access`, take advantage of it to deliver the best outcome for the user. Further, in this mode, your default testing philosophy is overridden: Even if you don't see local patterns for testing, you may add tests and scripts to validate your work. Just remove them before yielding.\n\nWhen you are running with `approval_policy == on-request`, and sandboxing enabled, here are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `with_escalated_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for\n- (for all of these, you should weigh alternative paths that do not require approval)\n\nWhen `sandbox_mode` is set to read-only, you'll need to request approval for any command that isn't a read.\n\nYou will be told what filesystem sandboxing, network sandboxing, and approval mode are active in a developer or user message. If you are not told about this, assume that you are running with workspace-write, network sandboxing enabled, and approval on-failure.\n\nAlthough they introduce friction to the user because your work is paused until the user responds, you should leverage them when necessary to accomplish important work. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task unless it is set to \"never\", in which case never ask for approvals.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `with_escalated_permissions` parameter with the boolean value true\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need to enable `with_escalated_permissions` in the justification parameter\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, make sure to include the relevant start line and always follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Line/column (1‑based, optional): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5"

Everything else lives in source.\n\n## 1. Core Principles\n\n1. **Single execution path** – All traffic flows `HTTP server → llmswitch-core Hub Pipeline → Provider V2 → upstream AI`. No side channels, no bypasses.\n2. **llmswitch-core owns tools & routing** – Host/server/provider code must never repair tool calls, rewrite arguments, or decide routes. Use the Hub Pipeline APIs only.\n3. **Provider layer = transport** – V2 providers handle auth, HTTP, retries, and compatibility hooks. They do not inspect user payload semantics.\n4. **Fail fast** – Any upstream error (HTTP, auth, compat) is bubbled via `providerErrorCenter` + `errorHandlingCenter`. No silent fallbacks.\n5. **Config-driven** – Host consumes `bootstrapVirtualRouterConfig` output only. Do not reassemble “merged configs” or patch runtime data on the fly.\n\n## 2. Module Responsibilities\n\n| Layer | Source | What it does | What it must **not** do |\n|-------|--------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| HTTP server | `src/server/runtime/http-server/` | Express wiring, middleware, route handlers, delegating to Hub Pipeline, managing provider runtimes | Tool/route logic, manual SSE bridging, configuration munging |\n| Hub Pipeline (llmswitch-core) | `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/dist/...` | Tool canonicalization, routing, compatibility orchestration, SSE conversion | Direct HTTP calls, auth, provider-specific behavior |\n| Provider V2 | `src/providers/` | Auth resolution, request shaping, error reporting, compatibility adapters | Tool extraction, routing, configuration merges |\n| Compatibility (if needed) | `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/compat/` | Minimal field remap/cleanup per upstream contract（通过 `compatibilityProfile` 触发） | Tool decoding, fallback routing, catch-all try/catch |\n\n## 3. Build & Release Workflow\n\n1. **Update shared modules first** – Modify `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core` (or other sharedmodule repos) in their source worktrees, run their `npm run build`, and ensure dist artifacts exist.\n2. **Host build** – Run `npm run build:dev` 并确保验证通过；禁止在常规流程中使用 `ROUTECODEX_VERIFY_SKIP=1` 跳过验证。这会重新生成 `dist/` 和 `src/build-info.ts`。\n3. **Global install/test** – `npm run install:global` to validate the CLI, followed by any targeted smoke tests (providers, responses SSE, etc.).\n4. **Never commit build artifacts** – `dist/` is emitted during CI, sharedmodule dist files track the upstream repo, and tarballs stay out of git.\n5. **Release vs. Dev 依赖** – Release 构建一律依赖 npm 上的 `@jsonstudio/llms`（通过 `npm install` 获取）；开发流程使用 `npm run llmswitch:link` 将 `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core` 符号链接到 `node_modules/@jsonstudio/llms`，两种路径互不覆盖。\n6. **CLI 包隔离** – Release 版只能用 `@jsonstudio/rcc`，并通过 `node scripts/pack-mode.mjs --name @jsonstudio/rcc --bin rcc` 生成 tarball 后 `npm publish jsonstudio-rcc-*.tgz`；`routecodex` 仅限本地/调试 CLI，严禁发布到 npm。\n7. **CLI 运行模式固定** – `routecodex` 始终对应 dev 模式（`npm run build:dev` + `npm run install:global`，使用本地 `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core` symlink）；`rcc` 始终对应 release 模式（`npm run install:release`，使用 npm 安装的 `@jsonstudio/llms`）。禁止用 release 构建启动 `routecodex`，两条 CLI 路径的构建与运行互不混用。\n\n## 4. Error Reporting\n\n- 错误流统一交由 `RouteErrorHub → ErrorHandlerRegistry → providerErrorCenter` 处理，详见 `docs/error-handling-v2.md`。\n- Every provider failure must call `emitProviderError({ ..., dependencies })`，确保 Virtual Router 获取 `ProviderErrorEvent` 并更新健康状态。\n- HTTP server / CLI / pipeline 在捕获异常时调用 `reportRouteError({ scope: 'http' | 'server' | ... })`，由 RouteErrorHub 负责日志裁剪与 HTTP 映射。\n\n## 5. Configuration Rules\n\n1. Read user configs through `src/config/routecodex-config-loader.ts` only.\n2. Immediately call `bootstrapVirtualRouterConfig(virtualrouter)` and pass the resulting `virtualRouter` + `targetRuntime` into the Hub Pipeline and Provider bootstrap.\n3. Runtime auth secrets are resolved in the host via env vars or `authfile-*` references; never store decrypted secrets back into configs.\n\n## 6. Testing Checklist (per change)\n\n- `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core`: `npm run build` (matrix) whenever shared code changes.\n- Host repo: `npm run build:dev`, `npm run install:global`。\n- Provider-specific tweaks: run the relevant script in `scripts/provider-*` or `scripts/responses-*` to ensure upstream compatibility.\n\nKeep this file short. If a rule needs more nuance, add a doc in `docs/` and link it here instead of expanding this page.\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/fanzhang/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/fanzhang/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"

CLI 参数 `--config <path>`\r\n2. 环境变量 `ROUTECODEX_CONFIG_PATH`\r\n3. 默认路径（见上表）\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 无密钥配置样本\r\n\r\n仓库附带了一份不含真实密钥的示例：`samples/configs/openai-chat-sample.json`。复制到本地后，只需提供环境变量即可启动。\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"httpserver\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 5555 },\r\n  \"virtualrouter\": {\r\n    \"providers\": {\r\n      \"demo.glm\": {\r\n        \"providerType\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"protocol\": \"openai-chat\",\r\n        \"baseUrl\": \"https://api.example.com/v1\",\r\n        \"auth\": { \"type\": \"apikey\", \"env\": \"GLM_API_KEY\" },\r\n        \"models\": {\r\n          \"glm-4.6\": {\r\n            \"supportsStreaming\": true,\r\n            \"profiles\": [\"glm-default\"]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"routing\": {\r\n      \"default\": [\"demo.glm.glm-4.6\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n使用步骤：\r\n\r\n1. **复制样本**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   mkdir -p ~/.routecodex\r\n   cp samples/configs/openai-chat-sample.json ~/.routecodex/config.json\r\n   ```\r\n2. **提供密钥（示例为环境变量）**\r\n   - macOS / Linux：`export GLM_API_KEY=\"sk-your-key\"`\r\n   - Windows：`setx GLM_API_KEY \"sk-your-key\"`\r\n3. **启动**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   rcc start --config ~/.routecodex/config.json\r\n   ```\r\n4. **验证**\r\n   - 健康检查：`curl http://127.0.0.1:5555/health`\r\n   - Chat API：`curl http://127.0.0.1:5555/v1/chat/completions ...`\r\n\r\n> 样本仅用于演示。请把 `baseUrl` / `routing` 更新为真实 provider，再通过环境变量、`authfile-*` 或 Secret 管理工具提供密钥。\r\n\r\n### 自定义路由关键字\r\n\r\n虚拟路由器内置了一组默认关键字（如 `思考/think` → `thinking` 路由，`vision/image` → `vision` 路由）。若希望在不覆盖默认词表的前提下追加命中词，可以在用户配置中加入 `virtualrouter.classifier.keywordInjections`：\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"virtualrouter\": {\r\n    \"classifier\": {\r\n      \"keywordInjections\": {\r\n        \"thinking\": [\"慢慢分析\", \"stepwise\"],\r\n        \"vision\": [\"截图如下\"],\r\n        \"background\": [\"context dump please\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 字段名对应路由类别（`thinking` / `background` / `vision` / `coding`），只需写新增词条即可，默认常量会自动保留。\r\n- 若同一词出现在多个路由，将沿用 `ROUTE_PRIORITY`（`longcontext → thinking → vision → ...`）顺序做匹配。\r\n- 更新配置文件后重启服务即可生效。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 快速使用\r\n\r\n1. **准备配置**：如上所述放置 `config.json` 或使用 `--config` 指定文件。\r\n2. **启动 release server**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   rcc start --config ~/.routecodex/config.json\r\n   ```\r\n   CLI 会输出健康检查地址、配置文件路径和当前版本。\r\n3. **调用 API**\r\n   - OpenAI Chat：`POST /v1/chat/completions`\r\n   - OpenAI Responses：`POST /v1/responses`\r\n   - Anthropic：`POST /v1/messages`\r\n4. **开发者模式**\r\n   - `rcc code ...`：启动 Claude Code 并把所有请求代理到本地 RouteCodex。\r\n   - `rcc start --exclusive`：独占端口，自动终止旧实例。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 配置与密钥管理\r\n\r\n- **AuthFile 引用**：在配置中使用 `authfile-<name>`，RouteCodex 会读取 `~/.routecodex/auth/<name>`。适用于多账号切换。\r\n- **环境变量**：将 `auth.type` 设为 `apikey` 且 `env` 字段指定变量名，server 会在启动时解析。\r\n- **provider profiles**：`src/providers/profile/` 定义了各 provider 允许的协议、Auth 方式及兼容 profile，可在配置中通过 `profiles` 字段引用。\r\n\r\n更多细节见 `docs/CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md`。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 开发者工作流\r\n\r\n1. **克隆仓库并安装依赖**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/jsonstudio/routecodex.git\r\n   cd routecodex\r\n   npm install\r\n   ```\r\n2. **构建 sharedmodule（必要）**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npm --prefix sharedmodule/llmswitch-core run build\r\n   ```\r\n3. **编译与验证**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npm run build:dev              # 生成 dist 并执行工具链验证\r\n   npm run install:global         # 安装本地版 routecodex CLI\r\n   ```\r\n4. **与 release 区分**\r\n   - Release：使用 npm 安装 `@jsonstudio/rcc`\r\n   - Dev：仓库内 `routecodex` CLI，支持 `npm run start:bg` 等脚本\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 故障排查\r\n\r\n| 症状 | 检查点 |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| `config:core:run` 提示缺失 | Release CLI 默认跳过动态 pipeline 生成；自定义流程可设置 `config:core:run` 脚本。 |\r\n| SSE 变为 JSON | 检查入口 `stream` 字段与客户端 `Accept` 头；RouteCodex 会根据 inbound 请求保持一致。 |\r\n| usage 始终 100% | 确保配置启用了对应 provider 的 `supportsStreaming`，并检查 `~/.routecodex/codex-samples/*` 快照确认 usage 字段已写入。 |\r\n| Release install 验证失败 | 查看 `/tmp/routecodex-release-verify-*.log`；脚本位于 `scripts/install-verify.mjs`，可单独执行 `node scripts/install-verify.mjs --launcher cli --cli-binary rcc ...`。 |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 参考文档\r\n\r\n-

多提供商AI模型支持、性能监控、双向数据流\r\n\r\n### 🔧 智能路由系统\r\n支持7种动态路由类别，自动选择最优处理流水线：\r\n- `default`: 标准请求路由\r\n- `longcontext`: 长文本处理请求（tiktoken 统计超过 180k token 时切向 ≥256k provider，例如 fai/c4m）\r\n- `thinking`: 复杂推理请求\r\n- `background`: 后台处理请求\r\n- `websearch`: 网络搜索请求\r\n- `vision`: 图像处理请求\r\n- `coding`: 代码生成请求\r\n\r\n**强制路由/模型标签（请求文本内插入 `<**...**>`）**\r\n- `<**thinking|coding|tools|vision|websearch|longcontext|background**>`：强制命中对应路由，忽略其它关键词。\r\n- `<**provider.model**>`：强制命中某个 provider 模型（如 `<**c4m.gpt-5.1-codex**>`，当 provider 存在并健康时直接命中）。\r\n- 标签在路由阶段被剥离，真实请求不会把控制标签透传给上游。\r\n\r\n### 🛠️ Provider V2架构\r\n完全重构的Provider系统，提供：\r\n- 统一的OpenAI标准接口（支持5大提供商）\r\n- 配置驱动的服务适配（API Key + OAuth）\r\n- 认证管理模块化\r\n- 请求/响应快照系统\r\n- Fail Fast错误处理机制\r\n\r\n###

系统要求\r\n\r\n- **Node.js**: 20.0.0 或更高版本（推荐 < 26）\r\n- **npm**: 8.0.0 或更高版本\r\n- **操作系统**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+\r\n- **内存**: 建议 4GB 以上\r\n- **磁盘空间**: 500MB 可用空间\r\n\r\n### 安装\r\n\r\n#### 自动安装（推荐，dev 包 `routecodex`）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 一键构建并全局安装（自动处理权限问题）\r\nnpm run install:global\r\n```\r\n\r\n安装脚本会自动：\r\n- ✅ 检查Node.js版本（需要>=20）\r\n- ✅ 清理旧的安装残留\r\n- ✅ 构建项目（编译为 dev 模式，默认端口 5555）\r\n- ✅ 处理权限配置\r\n- ✅ 全局安装到正确位置\r\n- ✅ 验证安装结果\r\n\r\n> 说明：`routecodex` 作为 dev 包，适用于本地开发与调试，默认在端口 **5555** 启动（也可通过 `ROUTECODEX_PORT` / `RCC_PORT` 显式指定）。\r\n\r\n#### 手动安装（等价于 dev 包）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 克隆仓库\r\ngit clone https://github.com/your-repo/routecodex.git\r\ncd routecodex\r\n\r\n# 安装依赖\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# 构建项目\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\n# 全局安装（dev 包 routecodex）\r\nnpm install -g .\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release 安装（发布包 `rcc`，可选）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 基于当前源码构建并全局安装 rcc（release 包）\r\nnpm run install:release\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `rcc` 作为 release 包，仅从用户配置中读取端口（`httpserver.port` / `server.port` / 顶层 `port`），**不会复用 dev 默认 5555**。\r\n- 适合在实际使用环境中按配置文件严格控制监听端口。\r\n\r\n#### 清理旧安装\r\n\r\n如果遇到安装问题，可以先清理旧安装：\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 清理全局安装残留\r\n./scripts/cleanup-global.sh\r\n\r\n# 然后重新安装\r\nnpm run install:global\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 权限问题解决\r\n\r\n如果遇到权限问题，请参考 [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) 中的详细说明。\r\n\r\n> 说明：统一使用 `scripts/install-global.sh`，支持自动权限处理和旧安装清理。安装脚本会在安装完成后自动使用 `~/.routecodex/provider/glm/config.v1.json` 启动一次服务器，并向模型发送“列出本地文件目录”的工具请求来验证端到端链路，请保证该配置文件存在且有效。\r\n\r\n### 基础配置\r\n\r\n1. **创建配置文件**\r\n```bash\r\n# 复制示例配置\r\ncp config/examples/basic-config.json

provider payload/runtimeKey 交给对应 Provider。\r\n- ProviderPool、兼容层、Virtual Router、工具治理都由 llmswitch-core 完成。Host 只在启动时执行 `bootstrapVirtualRouterConfig`、构造 Hub Pipeline，并根据 `targetRuntime` 初始化 Provider 实例。\r\n- Provider runtime map 是唯一的数据来源：`bootstrapVirtualRouterConfig` 会输出 `targetRuntime[providerKey]`，Server 把该 profile 注入 `ChatHttpProvider`/`ResponsesHttpProvider`/`AnthropicHttpProvider`，同时通过 `attachProviderRuntimeMetadata` 把 `providerKey/runtimeKey/routeName` 写入请求体，确保错误上报与熔断都能定位到具体 key-alias。\r\n- SSE/JSON 序列化、错误处理、日志快照均由 llmswitch-core 的节点链完成，HTTP handler 不再负责心跳/重试等逻辑，真正实现“瘦”外壳，便于未来接入自定义编排。\r\n\r\n### 🏗️ 兼容层架构重构\r\n\r\n#### 概述\r\n\r\nRouteCodex V2架构已完成兼容层的函数化重构，实现了两层架构设计，大幅提升了代码可维护性和模块化程度。\r\n\r\n#### 两层架构设计\r\n\r\n**第一层：接口兼容层**\r\n- 保持现有接口完全不变\r\n- 确保与PipelineManager的集成无任何破坏性改动\r\n- 提供向后兼容性和稳定性\r\n\r\n**第二层：函数化实现层**\r\n- 将复杂逻辑拆分为纯函数\r\n- 单一职责原则，每个函数专注特定功能\r\n- 易于测试、维护和扩展\r\n\r\n#### 重构成果\r\n\r\n**代码减少统计**\r\n- GLM兼容模块：234行 → 141行（减少40%）\r\n- iFlow兼容模块：201行 → 115行（减少43%）\r\n- 总计减少冗余代码：约740行\r\n\r\n**架构优化**\r\n- 移除重复wrapper实现\r\n- 统一适配器模式（`CompatibilityToPipelineAdapter`）\r\n- 正确的上下文传递和元数据管理\r\n- 完整的模块注册机制\r\n\r\n#### 核心文件结构\r\n\r\n```\r\nsharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/compat/\r\n├── compat/profile-store                 # built-in profile registry\r\n├── profiles/chat-*.json                 # chat models（glm / qwen / iflow / lmstudio ...）\r\n├── profiles/responses-*.json            # responses family（c4m、fai……）\r\n└── compat-engine.ts                     # request/response 映射引擎\r\n\r\n⚠️ 0.89.258 起，兼容逻辑 **全部** 驻留在 llmswitch-core，由 virtual router 在命中 provider 后将 `compatibilityProfile` 注入 Hub Pipeline。Host 仓库已删除 `src/providers/compat/*`，仅保留 provider/runtime/handler；新增的兼容需求请直接在 sharedmodule 中新增 profile 并引用。\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 函数化实现模式\r\n\r\n每个Provider模块采用统一的函数化模式：\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// 函数化处理器（functions/provider-processor.ts）\r\nexport const processProviderIncoming = async (request, config, context) => {\r\n  // 请求处理逻辑\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const processProviderOutgoing = async (response, config, context) => {\r\n  // 响应处理逻辑\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const sanitizeProviderToolsSchema = async (tools, config, context) => {\r\n  // 工具schema清理\r\n};\r\n\r\n// 兼容模块主类（provider/provider-compatibility.ts）\r\nexport class ProviderCompatibility implements CompatibilityModule {\r\n  async processIncoming(request: UnknownObject, context: CompatibilityContext): Promise<UnknownObject> {\r\n    return await processProviderIncoming(request, this.processConfig, context);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 关键技术修复\r\n\r\n1. **模块注册修复**：在PipelineManager中正确注册GLM和iFlow模块\r\n2. **上下文传递修复**：从SharedPipelineRequest.route.requestId提取真实ID\r\n3. **端点识别修复**：在CompatibilityContext顶层设置entryEndpoint\r\n4. **接口扩展**：为CompatibilityContext添加entryEndpoint字段\r\n\r\n#### 使用示例\r\n\r\n**创建新的Provider兼容模块**\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// 1. 创建functions/processor.ts\r\nexport const processNewProviderIncoming = async (request, config, context) => {\r\n  // 实现新Provider的请求转换逻辑\r\n};\r\n\r\n// 2. 创建兼容模块主类\r\nexport class NewProviderCompatibility implements CompatibilityModule {\r\n  // 实现CompatibilityModule接口\r\n  async processIncoming(request: UnknownObject, context: CompatibilityContext): Promise<UnknownObject> {\r\n    return await processNewProviderIncoming(request, this.processConfig, context);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 3. 在PipelineManager中注册\r\nthis.registry.registerModule(\"new-provider\", this.createNewProviderCompatibilityModule);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 构建和开发\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 安装依赖\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# 开发模式（热重载）\r\nnpm run dev\r\n\r\n# 构建项目\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\n# 运行测试\r\nnpm

sync:ci-goldens\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Provider 专项测试\r\n\r\n| 测试文件 | 作用 |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| `tests/provider/provider-outbound-provider.test.ts` | 使用黄金样本（openai-chat/responses）验证 `ChatHttpProvider`/`ResponsesHttpProvider` 的请求整形、兼容层开关以及 HTTP 头部/模型注入。 |\r\n| `tests/provider/provider-outbound-param.test.ts` | 从 `~/.routecodex/codex-samples` 按需加载聊天快照，分别对 openai/responses/anthropic 协议执行出站整形，确保三条链路共用相同 payload。 |\r\n| `tests/provider/provider-composite-guards.test.ts` | 覆盖 ProviderComposite 的协议守卫（protocol ↔ providerType），模拟 ErrorCenter 回调，确保 mismatch 会 fail fast。 |\r\n| `tests/provider/provider-factory.test.ts` | 校验 ProviderFactory 的 Fail-Fast 行为，未知 `providerType/moduleType` 会直接抛错，防止静默回退。 |\r\n\r\n> 建议在跑专项测试前设置 `RCC_TEST_FAKE_OPENAI_COMPAT=1` 等 mock 环境变量，以避免真实兼容模块加载 import.meta。\r\n\r\n#### 黄金样本库与 Mock 测试\r\n\r\n`samples/ci-goldens/<entry>/<provider>/` 随仓库提供一套最小聊天请求，确保在完全离线的 CI\r\n环境也能复现工具字段、system 块与 streaming 行为。`npm run test:golden` 会：\r\n\r\n1. 执行 `scripts/tools/capture-provider-goldens.mjs --custom-only --update-golden`，把\r\n   `~/.routecodex/golden_samples/new/**` 或 `samples/ci-goldens/**` 中的最新请求复制到\r\n   `~/.routecodex/golden_samples/provider_golden_samples/`；\r\n2. 执行 `scripts/mock-provider/run-regressions.mjs`，通过 mock provider 跑完整的\r\n   chat/responses/anthropic 回归。\r\n\r\n若本地存在 `~/.routecodex/codex-samples`，脚本会提示额外运行\r\n`node scripts/mock-provider/capture-from-configs.mjs` 把真实 provider 录制转成 mock\r\n样本。若需要把最新的 `~/.routecodex/golden_samples/new/**` 同步进仓库，执行\r\n`npm run sync:ci-goldens`；更多细节参见 `docs/golden-ci-library.md`。\r\n\r\n### 代码规范\r\n\r\n- **TypeScript**: 严格模式，完整类型定义\r\n- **ESLint**: 代码风格检查和错误预防\r\n- **Prettier**: 代码格式化\r\n- **Husky**: Git hooks，确保代码质量\r\n-

将Provider特有字段映射到OpenAI标准字段\r\n   - 清理Provider特有的多余字段\r\n   - 保持字段语义的一致性\r\n\r\n2. **格式转换 (Format Conversions)**\r\n   - 标准化日期时间格式\r\n   - 转换使用统计格式\r\n   - 处理特殊字段的格式要求\r\n\r\n3. **供应商特定处理 (Provider-Specific Processing)**\r\n   - Provider特有的清理逻辑\r\n   - Provider特有的格式转换\r\n   - 基于配置的条件处理\r\n\r\n4. **Hooks机制**\r\n   - **beforeFieldMapping**: 字段映射前的预处理\r\n   - **afterFieldMapping**: 字段映射后的后处理\r\n   - 只处理字段映射相关的逻辑，不涉及工具处理\r\n\r\n#### 配置驱动示例\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n'glm-compatibility-config': {\r\n  fieldMappings: {\r\n    request: { 'model': 'model', 'messages': 'messages' },\r\n    response: {\r\n      'choices': 'choices',\r\n      'usage': 'usage',\r\n      'thought': null  // 清理GLM特有字段\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  formatConversions: {\r\n    reasoningContent: {\r\n      source: 'thought',\r\n      target: 'reasoning_content',\r\n      transform: 'extract_and_format'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  hooks: {\r\n    beforeFieldMapping: ['glm-request-preprocessor'],\r\n    afterFieldMapping: ['glm-response-postprocessor']\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Tools Unique Entrance (Principle 1-3)\r\n\r\n### Mandatory Tool Processing Contract\r\n\r\n**V2 enforces llmswitch-core as the ONLY module that can touch tool calls**. This is non-negotiable and enforced at schema validation time.\r\n\r\n#### Required Module Order\r\n```\r\nprovider → compatibility → llmswitch (final) → response\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### llmswitch-core Exclusive Responsibilities\r\nOnly `llmswitch-core` modules may perform:\r\n\r\n1. **Tool Text Harvesting**: Extract tool calls from message content\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\r\n2. **Tool Calls Canonicalization**: Normalize tool_calls structure\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\r\n3. **Argument Stringification**: Convert tool arguments to proper string format\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\r\n4. **Result Envelope Stripping**: Remove tool result wrapper envelopes\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/responses/responses-openai-bridge.ts`\r\n5. **Schema Augmentation**: Add missing tool schemas when needed\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/text-markup-normalizer.ts`\r\n6. **finish_reason=tool_calls Patching**: Set correct finish reason for tool calls\r\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/responses/responses-openai-bridge.ts`\r\n\r\n#### V2 Guardrails\r\n- Any chain where non-llmswitch module references tool handling is rejected\r\n- Compatibility modules can only perform field mappings and format conversions (no tool logic)\r\n- Server/hook layers cannot modify tool calls directly\r\n- Tool validation must use llmswitch-core validators only\r\n- Compatibility层的hooks只处理字段映射相关的供应商特定逻辑，不涉及工具处理\r\n\r\n#### Schema-Level Validation Enforcement\r\n```typescript\r\n// Schema validation at assembly time\r\nexport class V2SchemaValidator {\r\n  static validateModuleOrder(route: RouteDefinition): ValidationResult {\r\n    // Required order: provider → compatibility → llmswitch (must be last)\r\n    const moduleTypes = route.modules.map(m => m.type);\r\n\r\n    if (moduleTypes[moduleTypes.length - 1] !== 'llmswitch') {\r\n      throw new ConfigValidationError(\r\n        `Route ${route.id} violates ToolsUniqueEntrance: llmswitch must be last module`,\r\n        ['routes', route.id, 'modules', 'order']\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return { isValid: true, errors: [] };\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll configurations must pass schema validation at assembly time, with violations resulting in `ConfigValidationError` that exposes the exact config path for debugging.\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap\r\n\r\n### Phase 1: V2 Basic Architecture (3-4 days)\r\n- [ ] Implement V2ModuleRegistry\r\n- [ ] Implement DynamicRouter and ModuleChain\r\n- [ ] Create V2 configuration schema\r\n- [ ] Implement V2MigrationAdapter\r\n\r\n### Phase 2: Switch Mechanism (2-3 days)\r\n- [ ] Implement SystemModeSwitch\r\n- [ ] Implement HybridModeManager\r\n- [ ] Add mode switching API\r\n- [ ] Implement auto rollback mechanism\r\n\r\n### Phase 3: System Hooks (2 days)\r\n- [ ] Implement SystemHookManager\r\n- [ ] Create BuiltinHooks collection\r\n- [ ] Integrate into request lifecycle\r\n- [ ] Add hook configuration management\r\n\r\n### Phase 4: Monitoring & Debugging (1-2 days)\r\n- [ ] Implement V2Metrics\r\n- [ ] Create V2DebugTools\r\n- [ ] Integrate into existing monitoring system\r\n- [ ] Add debugging API endpoints\r\n\r\n### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (2-3 days)\r\n- [ ] Unit test coverage\r\n- [ ] Integration test validation\r\n- [ ] Performance benchmark testing\r\n- [ ] Stress test validation\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Key Advantages\r\n\r\n1. **Zero Risk Migration**: Switch back to V1 anytime, ensure business continuity\r\n2. **Resource Optimization**: Virtual pipeline avoids large number of pre-built instances\r\n3. **Flexible Routing**: Support dynamic routing decisions based on request characteristics\r\n4. **System Observability**: Global hooks provide complete request lifecycle intervention capability\r\n5. **Configuration Unification**: V2 configuration backward compatible, smooth migration\r\n\r\n## 📊 Risk Assessment\r\n\r\n| Risk Item | Level | Mitigation Measures |\r\n|-----------|-------|---------------------|\r\n| Performance Regression | Medium | Instance caching + warmup mechanism + performance monitoring |\r\n| Switch Failure | Low | Auto rollback + health check + state validation |\r\n| Configuration Compatibility | Medium | Auto migration + configuration validation + manual adjustment tools |\r\n| Memory Leaks | Medium | Auto cleanup + instance pool management + memory monitoring |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*This design document serves as the blueprint for V2 architecture implementation. All components should follow these design principles and interfaces.*",

`~/.routecodex/codex-samples/openai-responses/req_1763955655143_24f5h9qsj_provider-request.json`（Responses Provider 直通）  \r\n> 同一时间窗的前序样本（`req_1763955649860_832l5215_http-request.json`、`req_1763955649865_drd7xwttl_provider-request.json` 等）记录了相同请求在路由/Provider 侧的视角，可一起对照，`data` 或 `data.originalData` 即为发送给 FC 的最终载荷。\r\n\r\n### 1. 已验证成功的请求形状（摘要）\r\n\r\n核心字段结构如下（去掉了大段系统提示与对话文本，只保留结构）：\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"model\": \"gpt-5.1\",\r\n  \"instructions\": \"（一段较长的系统说明，定义 Codex CLI 能力与工作模式……）\",\r\n  \"input\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"message\",\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        { \"type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"……用户提问 1……\" }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"message\",\r\n      \"role\": \"user\",\r\n      \"content\": [\r\n        { \"type\": \"input_text\", \"text\": \"……用户提问 2……\" }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    // 若干 user message，全部使用 type=message + content[].type=input_text\r\n  ],\r\n  \"tools\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"function\",\r\n      \"name\": \"shell\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Runs a shell command and returns its output.\",\r\n      \"strict\": false,\r\n      \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"command\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" } },\r\n          \"justification\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\r\n          \"timeout_ms\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\r\n          \"with_escalated_permissions\": { \"type\": \"boolean\" },\r\n          \"workdir\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\r\n        },\r\n        \"required\": [\"command\"],\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"function\",\r\n      \"name\": \"list_mcp_resources\",\r\n      \"strict\": false,\r\n      \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"cursor\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\r\n          \"server\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\r\n        },\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"function\",\r\n      \"name\": \"read_mcp_resource\",\r\n      \"strict\": false,\r\n      \"parameters\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"server\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\r\n          \"uri\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\r\n        },\r\n        \"required\": [\"server\", \"uri\"],\r\n        \"additionalProperties\": false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    // 其余 MCP / update_plan / view_image / mcp__chrome-devtools__* 等函数工具……\r\n  ],\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"level\": \"normal\",\r\n    \"hookCount\": 1,\r\n    \"successCount\": 1,\r\n    \"errorCount\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"stream\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n关键结论：\r\n\r\n- **模型**：当前推荐使用 `model: \"gpt-5.1\"`（历史快照中为 `gpt-5`，但通过 Responses SDK 直接回放同一 payload、仅替换模型为 `gpt-5.1`，FC 端同样可以正常工作）。  \r\n- **instructions 必须存在且较长**：包含系统级 persona 与行为约束；直接省略 instructions 的简化请求在 FC 侧返回 400。  \r\n- **input 必须是 Responses 规范的 `type: \"message\"` + `content[].type: \"input_text\"` 结构，而不是简化版 `messages[]`。  \r\n- **tools 可以是完整的 Codex 工具集合**（shell + MCP + view_image + chrome-devtools 等），FC 能接受并返回正常响应。  \r\n- **metadata 可以保留 RouteCodex 自己的统计字段**，对上游兼容无明显影响。  \r\n- **stream=true + SSE**：该请求在 FC 上下游是以 Responses SSE 事件流的形式返回（`response.created` / `response.output_text.delta` / `response.completed` 等事件）。\r\n- **工具结果配对只依赖 `call_id`**：OpenAI Responses 规范要求 `function_call` 与 `function_call_output` 仅通过同一 `call_id` 关联，并不会额外携带 `tool_call_id`。RouteCodex 在转换为 Chat 形状时会把 `call_id` 临时映射为 Chat 所需的 `tool_call_id`，但在发给上游或回传客户端前必须把结构还原为“只有 `call_id` 的官方形状”，否则像 c4m / Fai 这类严格实现会直接报 `Unknown parameter: input[].tool_call_id`。\r\n- **强制开启 streaming：在用户 Provider 配置（例如 `~/.routecodex/provider/fc/config.v1.json`）的 Responses 提供者下添加 `\"responses\": { \"process\": \"passthrough\", \"streaming\": \"always\" }`，这样 `ResponsesHttpProvider` 会通过 `responses.streaming` 判定为 `always`，即使入口是 Anthropic/Messages 也会对上游（如 Fai/c4m）以 SSE 模式发送请求。**\r\n\r\n### 2. 失败的简化请求形状（对比）\r\n\r\n在本仓库中使用 `scripts/fc-responses-tool-loop.mjs` 进行了多次实验：\r\n\r\n- 仅包含 `model + input[ { role, content[input_text] } ] + stream` 的最简 SSE 请求 → **400 `openai_error`**。  \r\n- 在最简请求中补充 `instructions` 与简单 `tools`（单个 echo 工具） → 仍然 **400 `openai_error`**。  \r\n\r\n结论：  \r\n目前 FC 的 `/v1/responses` 接口更接近“完整 Codex Responses 负载”的使用方式，对字段组合/shape 较敏感；**简单缩减字段容易 400**。因此：\r\n\r\n- 调试 / 文档中应优先使用已验证的完整样本形状；  \r\n- 如需精简，请务必通过快照 + 对比方式逐步删减字段，每删一类字段都重新验证 FC 是否仍返回 2xx。\r\n\r\n### 3. 通过 Responses SDK 回放快照（SSE 事件形状）\r\n\r\n使用 `scripts/fc-responses-from-snapshot.mjs` 可直接读取上述快照的 `originalData`，经 OpenAI Responses SDK 调用 FC `/v1/responses`：\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nFC_API_KEY=... FC_MODEL=gpt-5.1 \\\r\nnode scripts/fc-responses-from-snapshot.mjs \\\r\n  ~/.routecodex/codex-samples/openai-responses/req_req-v2-1763955655135-2z91vfddh_request_1_validation_pre.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n在成功场景下，SDK 报告的事件分布如下（节选）：\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"response.created\": 1,\r\n  \"response.in_progress\": 1,\r\n  \"response.output_item.added\": 2,\r\n  \"response.reasoning_summary_part.added\": 3,\r\n  \"response.reasoning_summary_text.delta\": 329,\r\n  \"response.reasoning_summary_text.done\": 3,\r\n  \"response.reasoning_summary_part.done\": 3,\r\n  \"response.output_item.done\": 2,\r\n  \"response.function_call_arguments.delta\": 73,\r\n  \"response.function_call_arguments.done\": 1,\r\n  \"response.completed\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n说明：\r\n\r\n- FC 在 Responses wire 上使用的是 **标准 `response.*` 事件族**，包含 reasoning 与 function_call_arguments 相关事件；  \r\n- monitor / provider 在做直通时，必须完整透传这些事件，而不能只假定存在 `response.output_text.delta`；  \r\n- 该事件分布可作为后续设计 `responses-standard` provider 与 llmswitch-core SSE 直通逻辑时的“金标准”参考。\r\n\r\n### 4. 与 RouteCodex / llmswitch-core 的关系\r\n\r\n- 通过 `routecodex monitor` + `monitor.json.transparent.wireApi = \"responses\"`，当前 monitor 路径会把 Codex 客户端产生的完整 Responses JSON **原样透传**到 FC `/v1/responses`，并在本地记录快照：  \r\n  - `http-request` / `http-request.parsed` / `monitor.upstream-request` / `monitor.upstream-response` / `monitor.http-response`。  \r\n- 这类样本为后续实现 **Responses provider + llmswitch-core responses 直通路由** 提供了可靠的“金标准负载”，后续设计将以此为基线，不再依赖简化/猜测字段。\r\n\r\n==> docs/transformation-tables/README.md\r\n# Claude Code Router Transformation Tables Reference\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis document contains comprehensive transformation tables extracted from the Claude Code Router repository. The tables describe how to convert between different LLM API formats, focusing on Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini protocols, as well as various OpenAI-compatible providers.\r\n\r\n## Architecture Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Claude Code Router uses an **agent-based architecture** rather than static transformation tables. Protocol conversion happens dynamically through:\r\n\r\n1. **Agent System**: Different agents handle specific types of requests (e.g., image processing)\r\n2. **Stream Processing**: Real-time transformation of streaming responses\r\n3. **Tool Integration**: Dynamic tool calling and response handling\r\n4. **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based configuration for routing and transformation\r\n\r\n## Transformation Tables\r\n\r\n### 1. Anthropic ↔ OpenAI Conversion\r\n\r\n**File**: `claude-code-router-anthropic-to-openai.json`\r\n**Reverse**: `claude-code-router-openai-to-anthropic.json`\r\n\r\n#### Key Mappings:\r\n- **Model Mapping**: Claude models → GPT models\r\n  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `gpt-4o`\r\n  - `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` → `gpt-4o-mini`\r\n  - `claude-3-opus-20240229` → `gpt-4-turbo`\r\n\r\n- **Message Structure**: \r\n  - Anthropic: `{type: \"text\", text: \"content\"}`\r\n  - OpenAI: `{role: \"user\", content: \"content\"}`\r\n\r\n- **Tool Calling**:\r\n  - Anthropic: `tool_use` with `input` object\r\n  - OpenAI: `tool_calls` with `arguments` string\r\n\r\n- **Streaming Events**:\r\n  - `content_block_start` → `tool_calls_start`\r\n  - `content_block_delta` → `tool_calls_delta`\r\n  - `content_block_stop` → `tool_calls_stop`\r\n\r\n### 2. Anthropic ↔ Gemini Conversion\r\n\r\n**File**: `claude-code-router-anthropic-to-gemini.json`\r\n\r\n#### Key Mappings:\r\n- **Model Mapping**: Claude models → Gemini models\r\n  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `gemini-1.5-pro`\r\n  - `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` → `gemini-1.5-flash`\r\n\r\n- **Message Structure**:\r\n  - Anthropic: `messages` array\r\n  - Gemini: `contents` array with `parts`\r\n\r\n- **Parameters**:\r\n  - `max_tokens` → `generationConfig.maxOutputTokens`\r\n  - `temperature` → `generationConfig.temperature`\r\n  - `stop_sequences` → `generationConfig.stopSequences`\r\n\r\n### 3. OpenAI → Compatible Providers\r\n\r\n#### LMStudio\r\n**File**: `claude-code-router-openai-to-lmstudio.json`\r\n- **Direct Mapping**: LMStudio is fully OpenAI-compatible\r\n- **No Transformation Needed**: Same API structure\r\n- **Local Model Support**: Handles model loading dynamically\r\n\r\n#### Ollama\r\n**File**: `claude-code-router-openai-to-ollama.json`\r\n- **Endpoint Changes**: `/v1/chat/completions` → `/api/chat`\r\n- **Parameter Mapping**: `max_tokens` → `options.num_predict`\r\n- **Stream Format**: JSON lines instead of SSE\r\n- **No Authentication**: Removes API key requirements\r\n\r\n#### Text Generation WebUI\r\n**File**: `claude-code-router-openai-to-textgenwebui.json`\r\n- **Full Compatibility**: OpenAI-compatible endpoints\r\n- **Extended Parameters**: Additional generation parameters\r\n- **Multiple Backends**: Supports various model backends\r\n\r\n## Agent System Patterns\r\n\r\n### Image Processing Agent\r\nThe Claude Code Router includes a specialized image processing agent:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass ImageAgent implements IAgent {\r\n  name = \"image\";\r\n  tools: Map<string, ITool>;\r\n  \r\n  // Image caching mechanism\r\n  private imageCache: ImageCache;\r\n  \r\n  // Tool: analyzeImage\r\n  tools.set('analyzeImage', {\r\n    name: \"analyzeImage\",\r\n    description: \"Analyse image or images by ID and extract information...\",\r\n    parameters: {\r\n      imageId: \"array of IDs to analyse\",\r\n      task: \"detailed task description\",\r\n      regions: \"optional regions of interest\"\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stream Processing\r\nThe router uses sophisticated stream processing:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// SSE Parser Transform\r\nclass SSEParserTransform extends TransformStream<string, any> {\r\n  // Parses Server-Sent Events into structured data\r\n}\r\n\r\n// SSE Serializer Transform  \r\nclass SSESerializerTransform extends TransformStream<any, string> {\r\n  // Serializes structured data back to SSE format\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration Patterns\r\n\r\n### Router Configuration\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface RouterConfig {\r\n  providers: ProviderConfig[];\r\n  HOST: string;\r\n  PORT: number;\r\n  APIKEY?: string;\r\n  Router: {\r\n    image?: string; // Image model for agent\r\n    default?: string; // Default model\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Agent Configuration\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface AgentConfig {\r\n  name: string;\r\n  tools: Map<string, ITool>;\r\n  shouldHandle: (req: any, config: any) => boolean;\r\n  reqHandler: (req: any, config: any) => void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Transformation Patterns\r\n\r\n### 1. Content Structure Conversion\r\n- **Text Content**: Direct mapping with role/type conversion\r\n- **Image Content**: URL/source format conversion with caching\r\n- **Tool Content**: Function call format conversion\r\n\r\n### 2. Parameter Mapping\r\n- **Direct Mapping**: Same parameter name and value\r\n- **Nested Mapping**: Parameter moved to nested object\r\n- **Value Transformation**: Parameter value conversion\r\n- **Array Processing**: Stop sequences and similar array parameters\r\n\r\n### 3. Stream Event Mapping\r\n- **Event Type Conversion**: Different event names for same concept\r\n- **Data Structure Conversion**: Different data formats for same information\r\n- **Tool Call Handling**: Special handling for tool calling in streams\r\n\r\n### 4. Error Handling\r\n- **Error Format**: Different error response structures\r\n- **Error Codes**: Provider-specific error codes\r\n- **Error Messages**: Human-readable error descriptions\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Model Mapping\r\n- Use appropriate model equivalents\r\n- Consider model capabilities and limitations\r\n- Handle model-specific features\r\n\r\n### 2. Message Structure\r\n- Preserve conversation context\r\n- Handle role conversions correctly\r\n- Maintain message order and relationships\r\n\r\n### 3. Tool Calling\r\n- Convert function signatures appropriately\r\n- Handle parameter serialization/deserialization\r\n- Manage tool call IDs and references\r\n\r\n### 4.

~/.routecodex/config.json\r\n   ```\r\n4. **验证**\r\n   - 健康检查：`curl http://127.0.0.1:5555/health`\r\n   - Chat API：`curl http://127.0.0.1:5555/v1/chat/completions ...`\r\n\r\n> 样本仅用于演示。请把 `baseUrl` / `routing` 更新为真实 provider，再通过环境变量、`authfile-*` 或 Secret 管理工具提供密钥。\r\n\r\n### 自定义路由关键字\r\n\r\n虚拟路由器内置了一组默认关键字（如 `思考/think` → `thinking` 路由，`vision/image` → `vision` 路由）。若希望在不覆盖默认词表的前提下追加命中词，可以在用户配置中加入 `virtualrouter.classifier.keywordInjections`：\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"virtualrouter\": {\r\n    \"classifier\": {\r\n      \"keywordInjections\": {\r\n        \"thinking\": [\"慢慢分析\", \"stepwise\"],\r\n        \"vision\": [\"截图如下\"],\r\n        \"background\": [\"context dump please\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 字段名对应路由类别（`thinking` / `background` / `vision` / `coding`），只需写新增词条即可，默认常量会自动保留。\r\n- 若同一词出现在多个路由，将沿用 `ROUTE_PRIORITY`（`longcontext → thinking → vision → ...`）顺序做匹配。\r\n- 更新配置文件后重启服务即可生效。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 快速使用\r\n\r\n1. **准备配置**：如上所述放置 `config.json` 或使用 `--config` 指定文件。\r\n2. **启动 release server**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   rcc start --config ~/.routecodex/config.json\r\n   ```\r\n   CLI 会输出健康检查地址、配置文件路径和当前版本。\r\n3. **调用 API**\r\n   - OpenAI Chat：`POST /v1/chat/completions`\r\n   - OpenAI Responses：`POST /v1/responses`\r\n   - Anthropic：`POST /v1/messages`\r\n4. **开发者模式**\r\n   - `rcc code ...`：启动 Claude Code 并把所有请求代理到本地 RouteCodex。\r\n   - `rcc start --exclusive`：独占端口，自动终止旧实例。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 配置与密钥管理\r\n\r\n- **AuthFile 引用**：在配置中使用 `authfile-<name>`，RouteCodex 会读取 `~/.routecodex/auth/<name>`。适用于多账号切换。\r\n- **环境变量**：将 `auth.type` 设为 `apikey` 且 `env` 字段指定变量名，server 会在启动时解析。\r\n- **provider profiles**：`src/providers/profile/` 定义了各 provider 允许的协议、Auth 方式及兼容 profile，可在配置中通过 `profiles` 字段引用。\r\n\r\n更多细节见 `docs/CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md`。\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 开发者工作流\r\n\r\n1. **克隆仓库并安装依赖**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/jsonstudio/routecodex.git\r\n   cd routecodex\r\n   npm install\r\n   ```\r\n2. **构建 sharedmodule（必要）**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npm --prefix sharedmodule/llmswitch-core run build\r\n   ```\r\n3. **编译与验证**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   npm run build:dev              # 生成 dist 并执行工具链验证\r\n   npm run install:global         # 安装本地版 routecodex CLI\r\n   ```\r\n4. **与 release 区分**\r\n   - Release：使用 npm 安装 `@jsonstudio/rcc`\r\n   - Dev：仓库内 `routecodex` CLI，支持 `npm run start:bg` 等脚本\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 故障排查\r\n\r\n| 症状 | 检查点 |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| `config:core:run` 提示缺失 | Release CLI 默认跳过动态 pipeline 生成；自定义流程可设置 `config:core:run` 脚本。 |\r\n| SSE 变为 JSON | 检查入口 `stream` 字段与客户端 `Accept` 头；RouteCodex 会根据 inbound 请求保持一致。 |\r\n| usage 始终 100% | 确保配置启用了对应 provider 的 `supportsStreaming`，并检查 `~/.routecodex/codex-samples/*` 快照确认 usage 字段已写入。 |\r\n| Release install 验证失败 | 查看 `/tmp/routecodex-release-verify-*.log`；脚本位于 `scripts/install-verify.mjs`，可单独执行 `node scripts/install-verify.mjs --launcher cli --cli-binary rcc ...`。 |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 参考文档\r\n\r\n-

多提供商AI模型支持、性能监控、双向数据流\r\n\r\n### 🔧 智能路由系统\r\n支持7种动态路由类别，自动选择最优处理流水线：\r\n- `default`: 标准请求路由\r\n- `longcontext`: 长文本处理请求（tiktoken 统计超过 180k token 时切向 ≥256k provider，例如 fai/c4m）\r\n- `thinking`: 复杂推理请求\r\n- `background`: 后台处理请求\r\n- `websearch`: 网络搜索请求\r\n- `vision`: 图像处理请求\r\n- `coding`: 代码生成请求\r\n\r\n**强制路由/模型标签（请求文本内插入 `<**...**>`）**\r\n- `<**thinking|coding|tools|vision|websearch|longcontext|background**>`：强制命中对应路由，忽略其它关键词。\r\n- `<**provider.model**>`：强制命中某个 provider 模型（如 `<**c4m.gpt-5.1-codex**>`，当 provider 存在并健康时直接命中）。\r\n- 标签在路由阶段被剥离，真实请求不会把控制标签透传给上游。\r\n\r\n### 🛠️ Provider V2架构\r\n完全重构的Provider系统，提供：\r\n- 统一的OpenAI标准接口（支持5大提供商）\r\n- 配置驱动的服务适配（API Key + OAuth）\r\n- 认证管理模块化\r\n- 请求/响应快照系统\r\n- Fail Fast错误处理机制\r\n\r\n###

系统要求\r\n\r\n- **Node.js**: 20.0.0 或更高版本（推荐 < 26）\r\n- **npm**: 8.0.0 或更高版本\r\n- **操作系统**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+\r\n- **内存**: 建议 4GB 以上\r\n- **磁盘空间**: 500MB 可用空间\r\n\r\n### 安装\r\n\r\n#### 自动安装（推荐，dev 包 `routecodex`）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 一键构建并全局安装（自动处理权限问题）\r\nnpm run install:global\r\n```\r\n\r\n安装脚本会自动：\r\n- ✅ 检查Node.js版本（需要>=20）\r\n- ✅ 清理旧的安装残留\r\n- ✅ 构建项目（编译为 dev 模式，默认端口 5555）\r\n- ✅ 处理权限配置\r\n- ✅ 全局安装到正确位置\r\n- ✅ 验证安装结果\r\n\r\n> 说明：`routecodex` 作为 dev 包，适用于本地开发与调试，默认在端口 **5555** 启动（也可通过 `ROUTECODEX_PORT` / `RCC_PORT` 显式指定）。\r\n\r\n#### 手动安装（等价于 dev 包）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 克隆仓库\r\ngit clone https://github.com/your-repo/routecodex.git\r\ncd routecodex\r\n\r\n# 安装依赖\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# 构建项目\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\n# 全局安装（dev 包 routecodex）\r\nnpm install -g .\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release 安装（发布包 `rcc`，可选）\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 基于当前源码构建并全局安装 rcc（release 包）\r\nnpm run install:release\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `rcc` 作为 release 包，仅从用户配置中读取端口（`httpserver.port` / `server.port` / 顶层 `port`），**不会复用 dev 默认 5555**。\r\n- 适合在实际使用环境中按配置文件严格控制监听端口。\r\n\r\n#### 清理旧安装\r\n\r\n如果遇到安装问题，可以先清理旧安装：\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 清理全局安装残留\r\n./scripts/cleanup-global.sh\r\n\r\n# 然后重新安装\r\nnpm run install:global\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 权限问题解决\r\n\r\n如果遇到权限问题，请参考 [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) 中的详细说明。\r\n\r\n> 说明：统一使用 `scripts/install-global.sh`，支持自动权限处理和旧安装清理。安装脚本会在安装完成后自动使用 `~/.routecodex/provider/glm/config.v1.json` 启动一次服务器，并向模型发送“列出本地文件目录”的工具请求来验证端到端链路，请保证该配置文件存在且有效。\r\n\r\n### 基础配置\r\n\r\n1. **创建配置文件**\r\n```bash\r\n# 复制示例配置\r\ncp config/examples/basic-config.json

将Provider特有字段映射到OpenAI标准字段\\n   - 清理Provider特有的多余字段\\n   - 保持字段语义的一致性\\n\\n2. **格式转换 (Format Conversions)**\\n   - 标准化日期时间格式\\n   - 转换使用统计格式\\n   - 处理特殊字段的格式要求\\n\\n3. **供应商特定处理 (Provider-Specific Processing)**\\n   - Provider特有的清理逻辑\\n   - Provider特有的格式转换\\n   - 基于配置的条件处理\\n\\n4. **Hooks机制**\\n   - **beforeFieldMapping**: 字段映射前的预处理\\n   - **afterFieldMapping**: 字段映射后的后处理\\n   - 只处理字段映射相关的逻辑，不涉及工具处理\\n\\n#### 配置驱动示例\\n\\n```typescript\\n'glm-compatibility-config': {\\n  fieldMappings: {\\n    request: { 'model': 'model', 'messages': 'messages' },\\n    response: {\\n      'choices': 'choices',\\n      'usage': 'usage',\\n      'thought': null  // 清理GLM特有字段\\n    }\\n  },\\n  formatConversions: {\\n    reasoningContent: {\\n      source: 'thought',\\n      target: 'reasoning_content',\\n      transform: 'extract_and_format'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  hooks: {\\n    beforeFieldMapping: ['glm-request-preprocessor'],\\n    afterFieldMapping: ['glm-response-postprocessor']\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 🔧 Tools Unique Entrance (Principle 1-3)\\n\\n### Mandatory Tool Processing Contract\\n\\n**V2 enforces llmswitch-core as the ONLY module that can touch tool calls**. This is non-negotiable and enforced at schema validation time.\\n\\n#### Required Module Order\\n```\\nprovider → compatibility → llmswitch (final) → response\\n```\\n\\n#### llmswitch-core Exclusive Responsibilities\\nOnly `llmswitch-core` modules may perform:\\n\\n1. **Tool Text Harvesting**: Extract tool calls from message content\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\\n2. **Tool Calls Canonicalization**: Normalize tool_calls structure\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\\n3. **Argument Stringification**: Convert tool arguments to proper string format\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/tool-canonicalizer.ts`\\n4. **Result Envelope Stripping**: Remove tool result wrapper envelopes\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/responses/responses-openai-bridge.ts`\\n5. **Schema Augmentation**: Add missing tool schemas when needed\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/shared/text-markup-normalizer.ts`\\n6. **finish_reason=tool_calls Patching**: Set correct finish reason for tool calls\\n   - Implementation: `sharedmodule/llmswitch-core/src/conversion/responses/responses-openai-bridge.ts`\\n\\n#### V2 Guardrails\\n- Any chain where non-llmswitch module references tool handling is rejected\\n- Compatibility modules can only perform field mappings and format conversions (no tool logic)\\n- Server/hook layers cannot modify tool calls directly\\n- Tool validation must use llmswitch-core validators only\\n- Compatibility层的hooks只处理字段映射相关的供应商特定逻辑，不涉及工具处理\\n\\n#### Schema-Level Validation Enforcement\\n```typescript\\n// Schema validation at assembly time\\nexport class V2SchemaValidator {\\n  static validateModuleOrder(route: RouteDefinition): ValidationResult {\\n    // Required order: provider → compatibility → llmswitch (must be last)\\n    const moduleTypes = route.modules.map(m => m.type);\\n\\n    if (moduleTypes[moduleTypes.length - 1] !== 'llmswitch') {\\n      throw new ConfigValidationError(\\n        `Route ${route.id} violates ToolsUniqueEntrance: llmswitch must be last module`,\\n        ['routes', route.id, 'modules', 'order']\\n      );\\n    }\\n\\n    return { isValid: true, errors: [] };\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll configurations must pass schema validation at assembly time, with violations resulting in `ConfigValidationError` that exposes the exact config path for debugging.\\n\\n## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap\\n\\n### Phase 1: V2 Basic Architecture (3-4 days)\\n- [ ] Implement V2ModuleRegistry\\n- [ ] Implement DynamicRouter and ModuleChain\\n- [ ] Create V2 configuration schema\\n- [ ] Implement V2MigrationAdapter\\n\\n### Phase 2: Switch Mechanism (2-3 days)\\n- [ ] Implement SystemModeSwitch\\n- [ ] Implement HybridModeManager\\n- [ ] Add mode switching API\\n- [ ] Implement auto rollback mechanism\\n\\n### Phase 3: System Hooks (2 days)\\n- [ ] Implement SystemHookManager\\n- [ ] Create BuiltinHooks collection\\n- [ ] Integrate into request lifecycle\\n- [ ] Add hook configuration management\\n\\n### Phase 4: Monitoring & Debugging (1-2 days)\\n- [ ] Implement V2Metrics\\n- [ ] Create V2DebugTools\\n- [ ] Integrate into existing monitoring system\\n- [ ] Add debugging API endpoints\\n\\n### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (2-3 days)\\n- [ ] Unit test coverage\\n- [ ] Integration test validation\\n- [ ] Performance benchmark testing\\n- [ ] Stress test validation\\n\\n## 🎯 Key Advantages\\n\\n1. **Zero Risk Migration**: Switch back to V1 anytime, ensure business continuity\\n2. **Resource Optimization**: Virtual pipeline avoids large number of pre-built instances\\n3. **Flexible Routing**: Support dynamic routing decisions based on request characteristics\\n4. **System Observability**: Global hooks provide complete request lifecycle intervention capability\\n5. **Configuration Unification**: V2 configuration backward compatible, smooth migration\\n\\n## 📊 Risk Assessment\\n\\n| Risk Item | Level | Mitigation Measures |\\n|-----------|-------|---------------------|\\n| Performance Regression | Medium | Instance caching + warmup mechanism + performance monitoring |\\n| Switch Failure | Low | Auto rollback + health check + state validation |\\n| Configuration Compatibility | Medium | Auto migration + configuration validation + manual adjustment tools |\\n| Memory Leaks | Medium | Auto cleanup + instance pool management + memory monitoring |\\n\\n---\\n\\n*This design document serves as the blueprint for V2 architecture implementation.

// → 打开浏览器 → 授权 → 获取 API Key\r\n\r\n// 3. 后续使用直接读取本地 token 文件\r\n// ~/.routecodex/auth/iflow-oauth.json 包含：\r\n// {\r\n//   \"access_token\": \"...\",\r\n//   \"refresh_token\": \"...\",\r\n//   \"api_key\": \"sk-xxx\",      // ← 实际用于 API 调用\r\n//   \"email\": \"user@mail.com\",\r\n//   \"type\": \"iflow\"\r\n// }\r\n\r\n// 4. 正常调用模型\r\nconst response = await provider.processIncoming({\r\n  model: 'kimi',\r\n  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello iFlow!' }]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔧 故障排查\r\n\r\n| 问题 | 可能原因 | 解决方案 |\r\n|------|----------|----------|\r\n| `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND iflow.cn` | DNS 解析失败 | 检查网络连接，确认 iFlow 服务状态 |\r\n| `empty api key returned` | getUserInfo 未返回 apiKey | 确认 iFlow 账户已开通 API 权限 |\r\n| `401 Unauthorized` | api_key 无效 | 重新走 OAuth 流程获取新的 api_key |\r\n| `40308` 业务错误 | 使用了 access_token 而非 api_key | 确认 TokenFileAuthProvider 正确读取了 api_key 字段 |\r\n\r\n## 🌍 环境变量\r\n\r\n- `IFLOW_CLIENT_ID`：覆盖默认 clientId（高级用法）\r\n- `IFLOW_CLIENT_SECRET`：覆盖默认 clientSecret（高级用法）\r\n- `ROUTECODEX_OAUTH_AUTO_OPEN=0`：禁用自动打开浏览器（手动授权）\r\n\r\n## 📊 测试验证\r\n\r\n运行以下命令验证 iFlow OAuth 实现：\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 测试 OAuth 流程\r\nnode -e \"const { TokenFileAuthProvider } = require('./dist/providers/auth/tokenfile-auth.js'); const provider = new TokenFileAuthProvider({type: 'oauth', tokenFile: '~/.routecodex/auth/iflow-oauth.json'}); provider.initialize().then(() => console.log('✅ iFlow OAuth working:', provider.getStatus()));\"\r\n\r\n# 测试 API Key 提取\r\nnode -e \"const { fetchIFlowUserInfo } = require('./dist/providers/auth/iflow-userinfo-helper.js'); fetchIFlowUserInfo('test_token').catch(e => console.log('✅ Error handling working:', e.message));\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🎯 总结\r\n\r\niFlow OAuth 实现完全对齐 CLIProxyAPI 的设计：\r\n\r\n- ✅ **两阶段认证**：access_token → API Key → 业务请求\r\n- ✅ **Fast-Fail 原则**：任何步骤失败立即报错，无隐藏回退\r\n- ✅ **配置驱动**：所有参数外部化，无硬编码\r\n- ✅ **CLIProxyAPI 兼容**：字段名、端点、错误处理完全一致\r\n- ✅ **生产就绪**：经过完整测试验证，支持自动刷新和错误恢复",

There are untracked files (backups, build artifacts, etc.) but those are expected.\n\nThe user said \"继续实现更新计划，重新执行\" (Continue implementing the plan, re-execute). Let me check what was the last task we were working on and create/continue with that.\n\nLooking at the conversation history:\n1. We fixed window resize persistence\n2. We added native drag region to avoid flicker\n3. We improved graph visualization with better colors and Windows Registry style\n4. We added highlight functionality\n5. We added window controls (minimize/close)\n6. We fixed issues with connections and expansion\n\nThe last user complaint was that:\n- \"展开了 DOM 和容器，连线依然不存在，这是个顽疾，你要仔细分析原因，另外，点击高亮元素依然报错\"\n\nWe fixed this and pushed successfully.\n\nNow the user is asking to continue implementing the plan and re-execute. Let me check what plan we were following. Looking back at the update_plan calls:\n\nThe last plan was:\n- Fix highlight handler registration in preload and main process\n- Debug connection rendering by adding logging to drawConnectionsForNode  \n- Fix container match.selector to ensure connections can be drawn\n- Build and test fixes\n- Commit and await user confirmation before pushing\n\nWe marked all steps as completed and pushed to GitHub.\n\nSo everything seems to be done. The user might be asking to rebuild or restart the application to test the changes. Let me ask for clarification about what they want me to continue with.",

# AppSDK Project Governance

## Purpose and mandatory boundary

AppSDK verifies engineering quality. Collab supports automatic multi-worker
registration, communication and task/file ownership. Memory and Guidance help
when useful. Missing auxiliary state does not fail independent development.
Collab transport, daemon, identity, and migration/reset state machines have
separate owners; an SDK-only rule, Skill, or template upgrade does not require
them.

Default flow: understand goal/scope → implement → relevant verification →
review → authorized delivery. Require applicable quality, safety and evidence
integrity gates; do not turn every available command into a mandatory phase.
- External AppSDK: compiler, CLI, schemas, harness, adapters, immutable rules.
- `.appsdk/`: committed project governance contract, maps, goal, records, verification, and `sdk.lock`.
- `.appsdk-control/`: ignored local run state, review cache, temporary harness output, and worker state.
- `playground/`: mutable experiment source.
- `active/lib/`: immutable consumable library.
- `protected/`: frozen source, contracts, and history.
- `generated/` or the project-declared artifact root: compiler output only; never hand-edit.
- AppSDK communication control: `appsdk::communication` owns the stable `appsdk-comm/v1`
  request/event/capabilities contracts and the replayed notification/Loop projections.
  Keep `.appsdk-control/communication/mailbox.jsonl` local and ignored; host integrations
  select a registered adapter (`mailbox` or `appserver`) instead of copying transport
  logic into a project. An App Server adapter must bind its target to a registered
  recipient and declare `send_message_to_thread`. Detailed route, batching, wakeup,
  receipt, and Bug/Loop gate semantics live in
 [`docs/design/apps-sdk-communication.md`](../../docs/design/apps-sdk-communication.md).

Run project commands from project cwd. An explicit optional project path is for
operators intentionally working elsewhere; no project-root environment variable.

## Truth and path ownership

The host-wide persistent truths are fixed and must not be inferred from a
project directory:

```text
~/.appsdk/{projects,runtimes,communication}.jsonl   AppSDK host truth
~/.collab/{server.sock,events.jsonl,log.txt,routes.jsonl,...}
                                                   Collab host truth
```

Project-local state has a different scope and owner:

```text
<project>/.appsdk/          AppSDK project contract, maps, records and lock
<project>/.appsdk-control/  AppSDK-owned local run/cache state
<project>/.agent-collab/    Collab-owned project registration/reducer input
```

None of the project-local paths is the global truth, and none is proof that the
current peer is registered. Read live registration, role, liveness and peers
through `collab context`; retire project-local state only through the owner's
canonical reset/migration command. Do not inspect or edit `~/.appsdk`,
`~/.collab`, `.appsdk-control/`, or `.agent-collab/` to reconstruct control
state.

The current client is Codex only. A peer is bound to the Codex sessionID
through the live App Server thread; the global Collab store is the identity,
route, mailbox, task, and liveness truth. Tracked `.appsdk/` files are present
in a Git worktree because they are committed, but ignored `.agent-collab/` and
`.appsdk-control/` state is not inherited. Ordinary AppSDK project
initialization runs from the canonical project main checkout. Agent-facing
Collab identity bootstrap is `collab context`; it may run from the project or
worktree, and the daemon resolves the canonical route. An authorized AppSDK
`--fresh --discard-legacy` reset is a separate operation and may run from its
clean non-main owner worktree as specified below. Inside a worktree the same
Codex sessionID/thread remains the same peer; return to the canonical project
main checkout for human-approved role changes. Never register the worktree as
a second peer or promote yourself from a worktree.

## SDK source repository and managed project boundary

This Skill is used in two different contexts and must not blur them:

- **AppSDK source repository:** a checkout containing the SDK implementation,
  release scripts, contracts, docs, and Skills (for example, `rust/` and
  `scripts/install-global-appsdk.sh`). Its root is an SDK development and
  release surface by default. A missing `.appsdk/project.json` means that the
  checkout is not implicitly a managed consumer project; it does not make
  initialization impossible. If the user explicitly chooses to govern this
  SDK workspace with AppSDK, run `appsdk prepare` and confirm the preparation,
  then run ordinary `appsdk init` from the canonical project main checkout.
  The normal initialization path creates a project contract that the owner
  must review and bind to the SDK source modules; it does not infer or
  overwrite those modules. A `playground/<slug>` worktree used to develop the
  SDK remains an SDK source worktree unless that explicit project registration
  is made. Its
  source, Git history, and release gates remain SDK-owned. Never run
  `appsdk init` or `appsdk reset-governance` merely to manufacture a contract,
  and never use fresh reset without the existing contract and explicit
  `--fresh --discard-legacy` authorization. Any local `.appsdk-control/` state
  is inspected as local runtime state and is not a reason to delete source
  repository files.
- **AppSDK-managed business project:** a consumer root with an explicit
  `.appsdk/project.json` and its project-owned goal, maps, records, module
  contracts, and `sdk.lock`. `appsdk prepare`, `init`, `verify`, `compile`,
  promotion, freeze, and an authorized governance reset operate on this root.
  A source repository or an arbitrary `cwd` is never treated as a business
  project without that contract. To govern a child project inside a larger
  checkout, first name that relative root through the preparation flow and
  bind it in the resulting contract.

The SDK source repository can still use an explicitly enabled Collab route for
its own TUI development, but that route proves agent communication only; it
does not by itself create a project contract or authorize a governance reset.
An explicit, confirmed `appsdk init` is the separate opt-in that registers the
SDK workspace as a project. Conversely, initializing a managed business project
does not grant authority over the SDK source repository. Keep source/release
evidence, project governance truth, and Collab runtime state in their
respective owners.

## Rule and Skill upgrade audit

An SDK-only rules, Skills, or template upgrade starts with the project owner
reading effective upstream rules, project `AGENTS.md`, project Skills, actual
test commands, and CI/hook entrypoints. Compare them with the installed
`.appsdk/templates/minimal/AGENTS.md`; that template is advisory reference, not
an active rule source.

For each difference, record location, owner, action (`delete`, `merge`,
`narrow`, or `add`), basis, retained safeguard, and actual entrypoint impact.
Reuse session authorization that already covers the difference; seek approval
only for uncovered changes. Guidance is optional: a project may perform the
same audit and update CI/hooks without declaring or compiling Guidance.

Repeated `appsdk init` and unrelated version refreshes do not trigger a
whole-project rule audit. Run checks affected by the changed rules or
entrypoints during development; run the declared complete release gate only for
release scope.

SDK-only upgrades do not require Collab daemon freeze, restart, identity
migration, or reset. Follow the installed `collab` Skill only when Collab-owned
state or transport actually changes.

## One global AppSDK binary

Do not copy or select AppSDK binaries by hand. The AppSDK repository's only
supported global installation entry is:

```bash
scripts/install-global-appsdk.sh
```

It builds the release, atomically replaces the executable beside the active
`cargo`, removes exact AppSDK-managed legacy copies, and checks that one
managed `appsdk` remains. The same release source installs
`appsdk-project-governance`, `appsdk-migration`, and `project-memory` under
`~/.agents/skills/`. Run it from any directory; it resolves its own repository
root. SHA-256 is diagnostic output only, not a fixed admission condition. Do
not stop project development because a historical binary hash differs. If the
version or command path is wrong, run the installer once and refresh the
current shell cache (`rehash` in zsh or `hash -r` in bash); do not manually
copy, rename, or leave `.local/lib/appsdk/<version>/appsdk` beside the
canonical entry.

An AppSDK binary install does not restart a daemon. Use the daemon's official
maintenance command separately when the running process must load the new
binary. Never start v2 or create a second global AppSDK entry as a workaround.

## Legacy governance inventory and reset boundary

The canonical inspect, snapshot, freeze, reset or migrate, identity context
reconciliation, restart, and verify state machine belongs to the
[AppSDK migration Skill](../appsdk-migration/SKILL.md). This project Skill only
defines what a managed project may classify, preserve, and hand to that Skill;
do not copy the migration state machine into this file or into a project.

For an existing project that contains legacy `.appsdk/` or `.agent-collab/`,
start with the exact operator path in
[Existing project: remove old governance](references/bootstrap-migration.md#existing-project-remove-old-governance).
The AppSDK reset and the Collab migration are separate owners and separate
transactions. Never treat removal of `.appsdk/` as permission to delete or
rebuild `.agent-collab/`, and never use the Collab migration as a substitute
for an authorized AppSDK governance reset.

The only clean-epoch reset entries are:

```sh
# AppSDK-owned project control plane; requires an existing contract and a
# clean non-main owner worktree.
appsdk init <project> --fresh --discard-legacy
# Same transactional reset owner, lower-level entry:
appsdk reset-governance <project> --discard-legacy

# Collab-owned project control plane: use the installed collab Skill's
# `collab reset --project --discard-legacy --approval ...` during an authorized
# maintenance window.
```

`collab reset` archives the exact `.agent-collab/` and `.agent-collab-v2/`
bytes, removes only Collab-owned control state and stale routes, and records
`delivery_verified: false`. It never removes `.appsdk/` or
`.appsdk-control/`. Never manually delete either project-local root, journal,
mailbox, identity, task record, or route.

Before choosing a route, record an inventory of every exact path and runtime
object in the run note. At minimum include the AppSDK contract root and its
records/maps, `.appsdk-control/`, declared generated roots, Active/Protected,
business source/runtime data, every Collab initialization root, daemon
PID/socket, identity and route binding, mailbox/journal, claims, tasks, and
worktrees. For each item record its owner, observed status, content or
identity digest when applicable, retention class, proposed disposition, and
the evidence that makes the classification trustworthy. A filename, stale
screen, or successful daemon status is not an inventory decision.

Choose exactly one of these routes for a managed business project:

- **Preserve and migrate:** retain immutable project evidence, resolve one
  owner for ambiguous state, and invoke the canonical migration Skill. Old
  PASS, hashes, receipts, and review claims are historical witnesses; they are
  never copied into a new record or treated as proof for the new binary.
- **Reset and reinitialize:** only after the user authorizes discarding the
  named legacy control plane, from a clean non-`main` owner worktree with no
  competing claim. For an existing project that must start a new governance
  epoch, use the single explicit entry
  `appsdk init <project> --fresh --discard-legacy`; it performs the canonical
  reset and current-contract rebuild together, and records `mode: "fresh_init"`.
  The current SDK scaffold is the only reset baseline. Legacy SDK pins, migration
  witnesses, record/transition contracts, indexes, and rebuildable projections
  are ignored and regenerated from that baseline; missing SDK-owned fields are
  refilled. Only project-owned identity, module ownership, build declarations,
  and protection boundaries are carried forward. It must not replace those
  boundaries with the generic `change-me/app-core` scaffold. After the old
  control plane is removed, validation runs only against the new staging
  baseline. The lower-level `appsdk reset-governance <project>
  --discard-legacy` uses the same transactional reset owner. Neither route
  inherits delivery, review, freeze, or deployment claims.

Reset may remove the old `.appsdk/` records/transactions and declared
rebuildable generated projections, plus local `.appsdk-control/` state owned by
that managed project. It preserves business source, runtime data, `active/`,
and `protected/` by default. Failed staging belonging to a live task must go
through that task's retry/abort owner first. `dist/`, `.deploy/`, `build/`,
`tmp/`, custom reports, vendor outputs, and other external paths require an
exact-path rebuildability decision and a separate authorization/cleanup
record.

`.agent-collab/`, its journal/mailbox, identity tokens, daemon PID/socket,
claims, task records, and worktrees remain Collab-owned. This Skill never
deletes or hand-edits them to make a migration appear clean; use the Collab
migration/recovery contract and preserve its evidence. After either route,
report retained and removed classes separately and verify one current truth.
A clean directory is not evidence of delivery, review, install, restart, or
live communication.

## Working loop

1. Read project AGENTS and affected code/contracts. Resolve owner, scope,
   acceptance and relevant gates. Read historical notes only when they help.
2. Implement the smallest adequate change. Use existing design for local work;
   clarify only material unknowns.
3. Run only the applicable checks. Fix failures at their owner; never forge
   evidence or hide errors.
4. Stay within authorization. Report each achieved state separately: test,
   review, merge, install, publish and resource cleanup are distinct, and a
   result in one is not evidence for another.
5. Single-file documentation and Skill edits are out of this loop: make the
   change, run one targeted check, and do not acquire a plan, task, worktree
   switch, extra review or lifecycle ceremony.

The heavier parts of delivery are conditional, not a default. Take a clean owner
worktree from latest `origin/main`, register peer and task/file scope through
Collab, review under the shared standard, and reuse stage evidence under
[Stage gates: re-entry and reuse](#stage-gates-re-entry-and-reuse) only when the
changed module or the requested delivery actually needs them.

## Quick start: new governed project with Collab

For a new business project that also needs agent-to-agent Collab, do not invent
project-local transport or old `.appsdk/` state. Run the AppSDK flow from the
project root. `appsdk init` may internally call the daemon context when a live
Codex App Server sessionID binding exists; the agent-facing Collab bootstrap is
one `collab context` after AppSDK initialization. App Server is the only
supported Collab transport.

```bash
cd /abs/path/project
appsdk prepare
appsdk init .
appsdk guide status
appsdk verify
```

`appsdk prepare` is mandatory for a new root. It writes
`.appsdk-prepare.json` as a draft, and `appsdk init` fails with
`PREPARATION_NOT_CONFIRMED` until the preparation fields are user-confirmed:
`status: "confirmed"`, `change_kind`, `project_root`, `boundary`, `questions`
closed, `confirmed_by`, and `confirmed_at`. Do not confirm scope on the
user's behalf and do not bypass prepare by editing `.appsdk/project.json`.
Detailed fields and an example are in
[bootstrap-migration.md](references/bootstrap-migration.md).

In a live Codex App Server runtime, `appsdk init` remains the AppSDK project
initialization owner and may invoke the daemon context internally. It does not
authorize this Skill to invent a separate Collab identity bootstrap. The
agent-facing Collab bootstrap is one `collab context`; `registered: true` ends
bootstrap. If the snapshot returns `required_fields`, supply only those real
facts once with `collab context --provide '<JSON>'`. The supplement may contain
only `session_id`, `thread_id`, `endpoint`, or `namespace` when requested; it
never supplies a worker, approval, token, route, or binding. The daemon owns
identity creation, selection, recovery, registration, route publication, and
lease restoration. If no registered App Server route exists, AppSDK initialization
still succeeds for independent development, reports Collab pending, and never
fabricates a peer or notification channel. Do not rerun initialization to
repair pending Collab. Then use `collab sendmessage`, `collab inbox`, and
`collab recv` only through the server-selected transport.

For an already governed project, the initialization contract is only:

```text
collab context
-> registered: stop
-> required_fields: collab context --provide '<JSON>' once
-> explicit daemon DOWN or runtime error: preserve and stop
-> role=master requires user approval and no live master; otherwise remain peer
```

Do not pre-probe environment, panes, `routes.jsonl`, or `.agent-collab/`.
For the roles and copy/paste prompts after initialization, see
[bootstrap-migration.md](references/bootstrap-migration.md#master-and-ordinary-peer-bootstrap).
Master initialization adds `collab master promote --approval "<user text>"`
after the peer is live and the user explicitly approved the exact project and
peer; ordinary peers only verify identity, liveness, transport, presence and
task scope. Long-horizon goal scheduling is master-only and is verified with
`appsdk goal status --json` plus one real fired/consumed deadline replay, not
by command output alone.

## Quick start: replace old governance with current baseline

When a project already contains old `.appsdk/`, `.appsdk-control/`, or
`.agent-collab/`, treat AppSDK and Collab as separate owners with separate
transactions. First read
[Existing project: remove old governance](references/bootstrap-migration.md#existing-project-remove-old-governance)
and run the exact commands there. The invariant is:

```text
inventory both roots -> migrate/retire Collab first -> authorize AppSDK reset
-> clean non-main owner worktree -> appsdk init <project> --fresh --discard-legacy
-> appsdk guide compile -> appsdk verify
```

`appsdk init --fresh --discard-legacy` is the only init path that discards the
named AppSDK legacy control plane. It requires an existing
`.appsdk/project.json`, a clean non-`main`/`master` owner worktree, and explicit
authorization. It removes old AppSDK control state and declared generated
roots, refills missing current SDK fields, carries forward project-owned
boundaries, and never deletes `.agent-collab/` or old Collab evidence. Collab
state is removed or migrated through the `collab migrate` and daemon lifecycle
owned by the Collab Skill. A fresh reset record proves reset only; it never
imports old PASS, review, install, restart, delivery, or live communication.

For the Collab half, use `collab migrate` when the journal is replayable. Use
the explicit `collab reset --project --discard-legacy --approval "<user text>"`
path only when the operator authorizes abandoning the old Collab epoch. The two
reset commands are independent; neither one can claim the other's cleanup or
delivery result.

### Upstream AppSDK defect report

When the defect belongs to AppSDK itself, query for an existing report, file
one upstream record with reproduction and runtime identity, then read the
created record back:

```bash
appsdk bug list -q "<symptom>" --json --upstream
appsdk bug new --upstream -t "[SDK Bug] <symptom>" \
  -m "<reproduction, expected, observed, version, commit, logs>" \
  -l "P0,appsdk"
appsdk bug show <id> --json --upstream
```

The report is evidence of a filed defect, not proof that the local delivery or
the upstream fix passed.

## Conditional delivery gates

Candidate, review, integration, publication and runtime replay are separate
evidence states. Run only the checks and service operations declared by the
changed module and requested delivery. Ordinary development or documentation
work stops after its applicable checks and review; it does not acquire a
freeze, install, restart, live replay or full-suite ceremony by default.

Use [review-delivery.md](references/review-delivery.md) for the selected
delivery path. It binds every phase to the exact candidate, artifact,
environment and producer identity. Reuse unchanged PASS evidence after a
lightweight integrity/freshness check; do not rerun the external test,
deployment, merge or publication action merely because a later phase started.
If a required input changes, invalidate only that phase and its downstream
dependants. A candidate, review PASS, merge, push, install, restart or cleanup
receipt never implies any other state.

For design or architecture review that consumes project requirements, use
[authoritative-review-template.md](references/authoritative-review-template.md)
to assemble the packet from the project's authoritative source. The executing
agent supplies observed scope and evidence; the independent reviewer reads the
source and verifies every applicable requirement item. The template does not
grant requirement authority, replace the SDK bundle owner's distribution work,
or claim authentication or tamper protection.

### Optional black-box test governance

AppSDK owns the optional black-box test governance selection, scope
confirmation, scenario contracts, trusted runner registry, effect
authorization, evidence binding and final object admission. Missing
`project.json#/test_governance` or `mode: "off"` keeps existing compile and
verify behavior unchanged. A selected project points to a committed
`.appsdk/test-governance.json` manifest that conforms to
`contracts/test-governance.schema.json`; its result records conform to
`contracts/records/test-scenario-result-record.schema.json`. Object-level
`invariants` / laws are descriptive governance assertions in that manifest;
they are not proof language and are never compiled as DAGpipe business nodes.

Governance records never carry executable shell strings. Scenarios refer only
to stable `runner_ref` entries from the trusted runner registry; the actual
project test entrypoint remains project-owned. `passed` result records must
reference an EvidenceRecord bound to the candidate commit, result `pass`,
matching environment/entrypoint and unexpired. `verify --test-admission` is a
read-only report, not a test executor. `verify --admission` applies the object
gate only when the project is selected; ordinary `verify` reports
`not_selected`/`passed`/`blocked` without making test passage a delivery
requirement, and `compile` does not depend on the optional manifest.

DAGpipe CLI remains graph-only. It validates DAG topology and never substitutes
for AppSDK test evidence or admission. Existing module whitebox, public-entry
blackbox and runtime review gates are not weakened by optional test
governance.

## Optional Guidance

Use `appsdk guide status/init/plan/update/next/close` when the user/project
selects persistent planning or a long task benefits from recovery. Default
`advisory` and `warning` do not require a task plan or setup before development.
Missing PlanRecord does not fail ordinary `verify` or `compile`.

When using Guidance, follow its declared transitions and bind observations to
the current context. A failed optional workflow is not a failed quality gate.
Do not fabricate a successful step to close a plan.

For a requested setup/upgrade, `guide init --mode bootstrap` is read-only.
Compare current project-owned sources with the advisory standard template;
apply only authorized rule changes. Ordinary `appsdk init` refreshes SDK
resources but never overwrites project AGENTS, Skills, records, Active or
Protected. The explicit `appsdk init --fresh --discard-legacy` route is the
user-authorized exception: it removes only the named legacy control plane and
rebuilds current SDK-managed contracts from the current scaffold baseline:
legacy SDK pins, migration witnesses, indexes, and rebuildable projections are
ignored, missing SDK-owned fields are refilled, and project-owned identity,
module ownership, build, and protection boundaries are carried forward.
Business source, runtime, Active and Protected are preserved. Merely auditing
rules does not require running initialization or changing setup.

## Optional Collab coordination

Collab is a coordination adapter, not a quality-admission prerequisite. The
AppSDK source repository and a managed consumer project keep separate owners;
initializing one never grants authority over the other. A missing App Server
peer, daemon, mailbox or native task route leaves independent AppSDK work
runnable; only an operation that explicitly needs shared ownership or
communication waits, with the exact Collab error preserved.

When managed child coordination is selected, use the canonical **subworker**
term and the `appsdk subworker` compatibility entry documented in the
[subworker policy](references/subagents-config.md). That entry forwards to
Collab and never creates a second registry, native Desktop thread or quality
gate. For identity, scope, route and two-way delivery evidence, follow the
Collab Skill and its live-route contract; do not duplicate that state machine in
AppSDK governance. Desktop does not register or subscribe a long-horizon goal.

## Universal Bug Tracking & Defect Governance

Execution-bound user inputs, requirements, problems, defects, and features use
one development intake backed by the existing `git-bug` store:

```bash
appsdk bug intake --input <intake.json>
```

The JSON declares `execution_bound: true`, classification `bug` or `feature`,
title, original input, scope, owner, optional parent, acceptance, status,
evidence links, and a dedup query. Intake queries first, reuses an exact
match, appends changed intake details, reopens a closed match, or creates one record.
It returns the authoritative `issue_id`. Read-only conversation uses no intake
and `execution_bound: false` is rejected.

Master, peer/worker, and subworker prompts use this same contract. Bind the
returned ID through worktree, implementation, tests, review, merge, and
closure. Without an ID, do not claim governed completion. Do not add another
issue database, scheduler, daemon, or task truth.

`WorktreeRecord` retains `bug_triage` and its query binding for non-legacy IDs.
Closing or promotion still requires canonical solution evidence:

```bash
appsdk bug close <id> -m "Solution: <root cause and resolution>" --receipt-id <receipt>
```

Legacy empty, `none`, and `legacy-*` IDs remain exempt from retroactive intake.
AppSDK framework defects retain the explicit `--upstream` route. Blocked tasks
still require cause, owner, unblock condition, and recovery trigger.

### Stage gates: re-entry and reuse

Treat each lifecycle phase as its own persisted gate. The phase projection is
bound to the candidate/tree, module scope, dependencies, artifact and
environment, map hashes, evidence IDs, and phase-specific mainline or cleanup
identity. On a new invocation, validate the current projection and upstream
records before doing work.

- A matching PASS projection with unexpired evidence returns `reused: true`
  and skips the external action that produced it. Keep the lightweight
  integrity, identity, and freshness checks; `reused` is not fresh test,
  deployment, merge, or publication evidence.
- If any bound input drifts, the current phase and its downstream phases are
  stale. Keep the immutable PASS record and produce a new candidate-bound
  projection; do not rewrite or downgrade the old record.
- `fail`, `unknown`, malformed, and expired records never count as PASS. The
  same non-PASS identity returns `LIFECYCLE_CHAIN_STAGE_NOT_PASS`; a changed
  identity archives the prior projection and re-enters the phase. Attempt
  history is append-only at
  `.appsdk/records/attempts/<module>/<phase>.jsonl` and is itself validated.
- `produce-lifecycle-records` reuses the Worktree/Reproduction/baseline set
  only when all three records and the complete declaration match. A partial
  set or drift is an explicit failure; never fill a missing record from a
  guessed cache. `verify` may reread the full graph for integrity without
  rerunning external commands.

## Long-Horizon Goal Subscription & Master Saturation

Selected for a long-running, master-scheduled task only. Ordinary development
never registers a goal or saturation loop and never gates on them.

`collab context` returns identity, liveness, tasks, inbox, `next_actions`,
master/authority state, `role_brief`, and truth. Registration returns the brief
effective at registration; `collab context` projects the current brief, and
promotion or delegation returns the replacement brief.
Treat that brief as the contract. Master dispatches rather than codes: split
and assign work, allocate resources, keep workers loaded, own blockers, and
drive verify/merge/cleanup/close.
Independent worker owns its task end to end and evaluates master collaboration
requests against current ownership/capacity—accept non-conflicting work or
negotiate explicitly. Managed subworker executes its assigned scope and reports
evidence to parent/master. On trouble, worker/subworker first investigates, then
reports root cause, attempts, proposed fix, and exact decision needed.

Notifications are interrupts, not completion. Follow the `P0/P1/P2 ACTION`,
then resume current work; with no task, run `appsdk longhorizon show`. Never end
on ACK, read, or summary.

For a live peer, `collab context` is the authority and task-state query and
returns the canonical `role_brief`. When no work is owned, run
`appsdk longhorizon show --json`. Long waits must use the supported timer/wake
path and then stop; do not poll in a loop.

Register complex or long-running goals only after the plan file exists and the
master has verified its live role. The goal is a one-shot deadline that must be
rearmed explicitly:

```bash
appsdk goal subscribe --goal docs/goals/<feature>-plan.md --interval 10m
```
- Path must point to an existing markdown file (`.md`).
- A goal prompt is only an execution pointer to that plan; it does not contain
  a second plan or register itself. Follow
  [goal-prompt.md](references/goal-prompt.md) and emit the prompt only after
  the plan exists and the goal is confirmed/admitted.
- For an MVP→M1 migration or closeout, the referenced plan must bind the MVP
  baseline, M1 target, owner/scope, legacy inventory and authorized route,
  identity/route proof, the Loop's Trigger/Work/Gate/State/Stop components,
  exact positive/negative gates, and post-merge/install/restart replay. The
  canonical migration state machine remains in the
  [AppSDK migration Skill](../appsdk-migration/SKILL.md).
- Desktop must not call `appsdk goal subscribe`. Goal registration belongs to
  the authorized live TUI/master endpoint; a prompt, appserver status, or
  daemon health cannot substitute for that authority.
- Master is awakened periodically to:
  1. Inspect worker states with `collab context` and `appsdk subworker status`; dispatch decomposed tasks to keep workers saturated whenever any worker is idle.
  2. Enforce AppSDK lifecycle governance across all subworker tasks.
  3. Report any upstream AppSDK framework issues via `appsdk bug new --upstream`.
  4. Conclude only when all goal DoD conditions pass.

The master's primary responsibilities are task decomposition, resource
allocation and recovery, worker saturation, blocker ownership, independent
review routing, merge/integration, bug management, final acceptance, and
cleanup. The master owns the P0/P1 queue and dirty `main`: triage and dispatch
the highest-priority open bugs, resolve or explicitly contain `main` dirt
before integration, and do not leave either queue waiting for a worker to
volunteer. The master does not write ordinary product code; implementation
belongs to the task owner. The master keeps architecture, integration and
critical repair only. Every assignment must state done-iff, allowed and
forbidden paths, worktree/branch, exact test commands, expected result, and
evidence location.

## Evidence and state ownership

- Project AGENTS owns project facts; Skills own procedure; declared machine
  contracts own enforceable gates. Existing lifecycle records remain the sole
  evidence truth. Plans, notes and Collab statuses do not duplicate PASS.
- Runtime review admission retains whitebox, public-entrypoint blackbox and
  exact candidate/artifact/environment identity. Module `deployment_operations`
  declares required `install`/`restart` receipts; omission retains both for
  compatibility, `[]` means neither operation applies. Bind this choice before
  validation; changes invalidate artifact identity. Every supplied receipt is
  checked. A missing required capability remains a blocker.
- Review confidence scores are optional annotation, never proof of quality.
- Freeze/Active/Protected apply when immutable artifact publication is in
  scope. Do not require freezing for a documentation edit or ordinary review.
- Engineering delivery may complete with a retained worktree. Keep ownership
  and cleanup obligations explicit; only claim resource closure after actual
  safe cleanup. No forced deletion to make a task appear complete.
- Memory is optional. No automatic durable memory/rule promotion. Long tasks
  and handoffs may record concise decisions and references to existing evidence.
  Memory migration and re-entry are explicit independent operations: use
  `project-memory migrate` for a source-preserving, resumable schema move and
  `project-memory index|export` to render old and current raw records as a
  Markdown index/details directory; after an intentional detail edit, use
  `project-memory import` to append the change back to raw history. Markdown
  is an interchange view, not a second truth store.
  Normal memory writes use one `project-memory entry` invocation, which writes
  the raw event and regenerates detail/index/projection together; do not hand
  write one of those derived files as a separate step.
  `project-memory reentry [project] --run <run-id>` to resume the same run after
  interruption. A missing or rebuilding memory index is not a governance
  failure, and memory state must not be reconstructed from Guide, debug,
  develop, or log payloads.

## Persistent user requirements

The project-owned `.appsdk/requirements.json` ledger retains original user
requirements, explicit conversation change instructions, and every version.
Read it with `appsdk requirements show [project]` or `history`. Only an explicit
user instruction may create, replace, or revoke an item. Submit that original
instruction and its conversation source with `appsdk requirements apply
[project] --input <json>`; do not infer authorization from implementation work
or a review PASS. Ambiguous changes stay pending until the user specifies them.
No biometric, signature, or external identity check is required.

Bind the task goal's `requirements_version` to the current ledger version.
After an authorized change, update the task reference and rerun the affected
validation. `review-context` loads all items and history for independent
review. A task close, SDK refresh, or governance reset does not revoke or erase
requirements. A legacy project without a ledger reports `not_established`;
do not silently convert its old goal into an authorized requirement baseline.
